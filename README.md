## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to propagate orbits around earth of a satellite mission that measures the atmospheric density and composition. The code allows to assess spatial and solar local time coverage of the measurements for different orbits and creates plots for visualization. 

The code has been created in the frame of the Collaborative Space Systems Design Project Course of the Aerospace Engineering Master at TU Delft. 

The github repo of this code is: https://github.com/nic-orbit/csdp_propagator

## External Contributions

This application is based on code provided by Francesco Pajero: https://github.com/FranzPaj/csdp_propagator

The authors would like to thank Francesco Pajero, student at TU Delft in the Spaceflight Dynamics track of the Aerospace Engineering Master, for his assistance in providing the skeleton code for the orbit propagation. He provided assistance on a completely voluntarily basis, sacrificing his valuable study time to help his friends and colleagues in need. It is undenyable that his knowledge about setting up the tudat-python environment was an important prerequisit for the creation of this code in the frame of the CSDP course.
